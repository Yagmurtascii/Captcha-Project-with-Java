# CAPTCHA PROJECT WITH JAVA
[CAPTCHA](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1217728?hl=en) (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a type of security measure known as challenge-response authentication. CAPTCHA helps protect you from spam and password decryption by asking you to complete a simple test that proves you are human and not a computer trying to break into a password protected account.


## Description

When the application is opened, users see two labels, one text field, and three buttons.
* **Labels**
     * **_Informative Label:_**  Gives information when you click the control button
     * **_Random Label:_**  Keeps random expression

* **TextField:** Takes expression from users

* **Buttons**
     * **_Refresh Button:_**  Create a new label (changes random label expression)
     * **_Sound Button:_**  Listen to text speech

      - If it is false, the informative label gives information "Please try again..." to users and the text field is cleared.
